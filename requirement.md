Project Summary:
A client-side image conversion web application that allows users to:
Upload multiple images through drag-and-drop or file selection
Convert images between various formats (bmp, eps, gif, ico, jpeg, jpg, odd, png, psd, svg, tga, tiff, webp)
Preview converted images before downloading
Download converted images individually or in bulk
Maintain original filenames with new extensions
No size restrictions or file type limitations
No additional image editing or optimization features needed




1. User lands on the main page with a prominent drop zone
They can drag-and-drop or click to select multiple images
For each uploaded image:
Show preview
Allow output format selection
Display conversion status
After conversion:
Show preview of converted image
Provide individual and bulk download options
5. Features in Detail:
Real-time preview of uploaded images
Batch processing capability
Progress indicators for conversion process
Error handling and user feedback

Document Conversion Requirements:
Supported Formats (Both Input and Output):
DOC (Microsoft Word Document)
DOCX (Microsoft Word Open XML Document)
PDF (Portable Document Format)
PS (PostScript)
TXT (Plain Text)
RTF (Rich Text Format)
This means users should be able to convert between any of these formats, for example:
PDF to DOCX
DOCX to PDF
RTF to TXT
PS to PDF
DOC to DOCX
etc.



Create the server-side API route for handling conversions
Update the client interface to support document formats
Add proper error handling and progress tracking
Implement file cleanup after conversion
Before I proceed, I should mention that we'll need to:
1. Install Pandoc on the server
2. Handle temporary file storage (for the conversion process)
3. Set up proper file size limits and timeout handling
